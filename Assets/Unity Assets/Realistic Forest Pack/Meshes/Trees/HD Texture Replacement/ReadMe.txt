HD Tree Texture Replacement

These textures are intended as a replacement for Unity Tree Creator
generated textures. The generated textures are low res (1024x1024)
and as such negatively impact visual quality of the trees.

How to replace the textures:

- copy diffuse.png and normal_specular.png from one of the tree folder (eg. Oak)

- navigate to chosen tree texture folder in the /Meshes/Trees folder (eg. /Meshes/Trees/oak_1_Texture)

- paste and overwrite the files

- In the Import Settings for the replaced textures choose desired resolution. Max is 4096, with the exception
of birch textures with are 2048
